// Changelog

This is a pretty minor update this month. Next cycle (2201) is expected to have major changes.

  / ANR Database Updates
    - Addition of the KETUS and GOMIK IFR waypoints
    - Removal of the GOBIN and KETOT IFR waypoints.
    - Minor updates to the lateral bounds of some Restricted Areas.

  / Dataset Additions
    - feat: Addition of NZCM, NTTT, and NSFA positions. This is due to dataset commonality, and serves no additional purpose.
    - fix: Palmerston North STAR designation fixes.
