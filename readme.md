# VATNZ EuroScope Sector Files Project


[![Current AIRAC](https://img.shields.io/badge/Current%20AIRAC-2113-blue)](https://github.com/vatnz-dev/SectorFiles) [![Next Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next%20Release-27%20January-blueviolet)](https://github.com/vatnz-dev/SectorFiles) 



The VATNZ EuroScope Sector Files project is an open source collaborative project allowing members of the VATNZ community to work together to create high-quality Sector Files to use in EuroScope.

A new sector file will be released in line with each AIRAC cycle (as long as significant changes warrant such as release). 

## Releases

A **major dataset update** will be released in line with each AIRAC cycle, as long as there are significant enough changes to the NZAIP that warrants such a release. A **major dataset release** will follow the traditional 21xx format, with the first release of an AIRAC cycle being **Revision A** (ie 2101 Rev A)

A **minor dataset update** will be released between each AIRAC cycle, allowing for emergency fixes that cannot be held back until a major dataset release. This may include airspace updates, or minor configuration changes. Each subsequent dataset release will incrementally increase the revision letter.

A changelog is not actively maintained for these Sector Files, however release notes are included in each release outlining the changes.

## Contributing

A contribution guide has been written for VATNZ projects and is available in [the vatSys repository](https://github.com/vatSys/new-zealand-dataset/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). All members who wish to make contributions to the Dataset are to adhere to these guidelines, otherwise their changes may be revoked.
